# Valencia Bikeway

Behold a modest proposal to add a two-way protected cycletrack on the east side of Valencia St and converting the other lane to alternating one-way traffic, with lots of commercial and 10-minute loading zones as well as accessible blue-zone parking alongside parklets.

Also shows bus lanes - 55 (15th), 27 (24th to CC), 12 (26th to CC) and SFPD access along 18th.

Not totally sure yet what traffic would looks like north of 14th and south of 24th.
